# Smart-CPU-Cooling-System-Using-Arduino
The "CPU Cooler Using Arduino" project is a smart cooling system designed to maintain optimal CPU temperature using both dynamic fan control and liquid coolant circulation. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller to monitor the CPU temperature in real-time with a sensor. Based on the temperature readings, the Arduino adjusts the fan speed and activates the liquid pump for enhanced cooling. This energy-efficient and cost-effective solution prevents overheating, improves performance, and is ideal for use in areas without air conditioning, offering quiet operation and extended device lifespan.
